# patchelf-wrapper
**patchelf-wrapper** is a simple Python module that assists in the installation
of the [*patchelf*](https://nixos.org/patchelf.html) utility. It's intended for
use with PyPI-hosted Python projects that depend on patchelf. If you're an
end-user of patchelf, you should look elsewhere! (Perhaps your OS's package
manager?)

Currently, patchelf-wrapper installs **patchelf 0.11**.

## Usage

Ordinarily, you'll just want to set `'patchelf-wrapper'` as one of your
requirements (e.g. in `setup.py`). If installing directly, you can just use
`python setup.py install` or `python setup.py build` as usual; this respects all
the usual options, including automatically installing patchelf into the `bin`
dir of a virtualenv if one is active.

In addition, patchelf-wrapper contains the following setup commands beyond the
defaults:

* `check_patchelf`: Checks if patchelf is already installed on the system
* `build_patchelf`: Extract patchelf's source and build it
* `install_patchelf`: Install patchelf to the chosen location
